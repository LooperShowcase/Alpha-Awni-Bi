    <a href="#news">News</a>Nike Introduces Phantom Luna, the Company’s Most
    Thoughtful Women’s Led Football Boot What to know Ahead of this summer’s
    historic tournament, Nike’s new Phantom Luna boot is the most innovative and
    researched women’s-led boot in company history. Serving the future of
    athletes and sport, Phantom Luna obsesses traction, fit, and feel for female
    footballers’ needs. Phantom Luna features a breakthrough new traction
    pattern, Nike Cyclone 360, reducing rotational traction and helping players
    move with agility, precision, and confidence on the field. The women’s
    football game has never been more competitive or more celebrated. The
    matches are high scoring, the teams attack as one and each player covers a
    lot of ground. The evolution of the game calls for an evolution of the
    product that athletes are wearing on the pitch. Backed by Nike’s most
    meaningful investment in women yet, the company reimagined a boot with her
    at the center of the process every step of the way, taking more than two
    years for research, trialing, designing, and styling. Ahead of this summer’s
    historic tournament in Australia and New Zealand, Nike is excited to unveil
    Phantom Luna, the company’s most innovative and researched women’s-led boot.
    Listening to the voice of the athlete, Nike Phantom Luna obsesses traction,
    fit, and feel for female footballers. First, Nike reimaged traction for her.
    While an elite footballer might run more than seven miles during a 90-minute
    match, the split-second changes of direction — dictated by a boot’s
    rotational traction — are what often decide the outcome. After years of
    study from Nike’s team of scientists and engineers, Phantom Luna features a
    new, breakthrough circular stud pattern near the toes that hits the sweet
    spot of traction. Named Nike Cyclone 360, this traction pattern allows
    players to move with agility, precision, and confidence on the pitch.
    Phantom Luna’s fit is also tuned to the female footballer. Featuring a new
    upper design, Nike Asym Fit, the boot has a more snug fit around the ankle,
    based on feedback from female footballers. As the women’s game intensifies
    and the style of play leans toward attacking as a team, female footballers
    need their boots to accommodate quick passes and accuracy as they move down
    the pitch. Because her foot, on average, is smaller than that of her male
    counterpart, she needs bigger touch zones for this control and accuracy.
    Nike applied its latest football innovation, Nike Gripknit, to the Phantom
    Luna upper, for optimal boot-to-ball connection. The coating gives a “tacky”
    feeling and is integrated into the material, so the boot stays soft and
    pliable. “Phantom Luna is a direct reflection of Nike’s focus on being her
    biggest champion,” says Dr. Elysia Davis, Principal Researcher in the Nike
    Sport Research Lab. “From research to testing to design, we put her at the
    center of the process. With Phantom Luna, we’re offering a boot that is
    thoughtfully designed for her with a new circular stud pattern and fit,
    helping athletes to move with precision and confidence on the pitch.” Nike
    Phantom Luna Elite and Phantom Luna will be available starting late June
    2023 at nike.com and select retailers. To learn more about Phantom Luna and
